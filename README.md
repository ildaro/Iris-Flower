## Introduction
The goal of this project is to investigate the famous Iris flower dataset and find interesting observations through the use of Python
and related tools. The Iris flower data set is a classic dataset that is traditionally used for classification and prediction i.e. to see
which features of the Iris can identify the flower to be a specific type of Iris. The data set is also frequently used in the world of computing and data science.

The data set was first introduced by the well-known statistician and biologist Ronald Fischer in 1936, it consists of 50 samples each from
the following 3 species of Iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica. Each sample has 4 features measured in centimetres:
petal width, petal length, sepal width and sepal length.
